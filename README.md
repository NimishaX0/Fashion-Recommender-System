FASHION RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

Designed and implemented a personalized fashion recommendation system using Neural Collaborative Filtering on the H&M dataset.
The project addressed challenges such as interaction sparsity, temporal drift, and cold-start user handling. 
Feature engineering techniques included frequency-based filtering, popularity bucketing, and time-aware splitting. 
The model was trained using PyTorch with dynamic learning rate selection and evaluated using a week-wise temporal split to simulate realistic deployment.
Further extensions are planned for the next semester to integrate article metadata and ranking-based loss functions for improved personalization and outlier robustness.
